\subsubsection{Testing for Weak Transport Layer Security (WSTG-CRYP-01)}
\par
\emph{Test objectives:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Validate the service configuration.
    \item Review the digital certificate's cryptographic strength and validity.
    \item Ensure that the TLS security is not bypassable and is properly implemented across the application.
\end{itemize}}
